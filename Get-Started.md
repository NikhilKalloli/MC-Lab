### STEP 1: 
Open Keil Software -> Go to project Tab -> New Î¼Vision Project -> Go to nu folder on Desktop -> Nuvoton Platform -> Sample -> EduSample -> Create a new folder -> create a file(without extension)

### STEP 2:  
A dialogue box will appear where we need to select Device for Target.  
Under Database -> Select Nuvoton -> Select it last Version (NUC140VE3AN) -> click OK

### STEP 3:  
click on Target1 -> Source Group1 (right click) -> Add files to group 1 -> Go to nu140 -> CMIS -> CMO -> CoreSupport -> core_cm0.c
Do the same thing again but this time -> DeviceSupport -> Nuvoton -> NUC1xx -> system_NUC1xx.c

### STEP 4:  
Target1(right click) -> options for target 1 -> C/C++ -> Include Paths (click on 3 dots) -> new Path (dotted rectangle) ->  Go to nu140 -> CMIS -> CMO -> CoreSupport  
  
Target1(right click) -> options for target 1 -> C/C++ -> Include Paths (click on 3 dots) -> new Path (dotted rectangle) ->  Go to nu140 -> CMIS -> CMO -> DeviceSupport  
  
Target1(right click) -> options for target 1 -> C/C++ -> Include Paths (click on 3 dots) -> new Path (dotted rectangle) ->  Go to nu140 ->  NuvtonPlatform_keil -> Include  
  

### STEP 5:  
click on new file -> type your code -> save in same path as in STEP 1  
  
More specifically (to save):  Go to nu folder on Desktop -> Nuvoton Platform -> Sample -> EduSample -> your previously created folder -> save with exetension (.asm)  

### STEP 6:  
Source Group 1(right click) ->  Add files to group 1 -> Choose yourfile.asm -> Add  

### STEP 7:  
click on build (top left corner) -> if build sucessfull -> click on debug (red color, middle of title bar)
